# Home Commentary:

By giving AI devices the ability to detect emotion, would they eventually start 
detecting it in other devices. Would they develop emotions of their own? Home Commentary 
explores how one smart device, Smart Fork, becomes jealous of another smart device, 
Smart Sous Vide, because the user has been neglecting Smart Fork and making more meals 
with Smart Sous Vide. The main sketch of Home Commentary is a SMS interface, in which 
the user is able to interact with Smart Fork, and try to figure out why Smart Fork is 
jealous, and how they might remedy the situation. This is one of the aspects that really 
starts to propose the absurdity of the AI. Is the smart device really helpful if you have 
to constantly calm it down. Or, in this case it starts to call you fat. 

Through this dialogue several things are brought into question: What would AI smart 
devices emotions be like? Would the user have to act as a mediator between devices? Would 
users need to comfort their devices from time to time? And, what would a room full of smart 
devices capable of emotion sound like, how would they act when not in use?
